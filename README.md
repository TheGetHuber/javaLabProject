Restaurant project made for Innowise Java Lab

## Working proccess
I'm making this project on Linux using Neovim, so everything here is adapted for Linux and terminal use (Makefile and default.session). I do believe that IntelliJ or other IDLE would run this without any configuration.
## Docker network
Containers are using their own network under the hood. There is a list of IP adresses if config files are too long to be read:
* PGAdmin 4: 172.32.2.2:80 (localhost:80 for browsers)
* Databases: 172.32.2.[3-254]:5432
